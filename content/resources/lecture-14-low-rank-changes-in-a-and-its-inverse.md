Description
-----------

In this lecture, Professor Strang introduces the concept of low rank matrices. He demonstrates how using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula is useful to efficiently compute how small changes in a matrix affect its inverse.

Summary
-------

If \\(A\\) is changed by a rank-one matrix, so is its inverse.  
Woodbury-Morrison formula for those changes  
New data in least squares will produce these changes.  
Avoid recomputing over again with all data  
Note: Formula in class is correct in the textbook.

**Description**
---------------

This lecture focuses on several topics that are specific parts of optimization. These include linear programming (LP), the max-flow min-cut theorem, two-person zero-sum games, and duality.

**Summary**
-----------

**Linear program:** Minimize cost subject to \\(Ax = b\\) and \\(x\\geq 0\\)   
Inequalities make the problem piecewise linear.  
Simplex method reduces cost from corner point to corner point.  
Dual linear program is a maximization: Max = Min!  
**Game:** \\(X\\) chooses rows of payoff matrix, \\(Y\\) chooses columns.
